## Overnight autonomous run — operating exception (2026-07-29/30)

This project was bootstrapped and built through prompts 01–17 in a **single unattended overnight
run**, one prompt at a time, in numeric order. Two deviations from the starter kit's normal rules
were explicitly authorised by the owner for this run only:

1. **Self-merge authorised.** The kit's rule is "push the branch, never self-merge — a human
   reviews and merges." For this overnight run there was no human to review, so each feature branch,
   once `composer check` passed, was committed, pushed, and **merged into `main` by the agent**
   (`git merge --no-ff`), then the local feature branch deleted. Normal review-before-merge resumes
   after this run. Every merged branch is still a discrete, reviewable unit in history.
2. **Checkpoints auto-resolved, not paused.** Where a prompt has an architecture checkpoint or a
   "stop and wait for human approval" instruction, the agent did **not** stop. It chose the option
   the prompt marks as recommended (or the client-facing default in
   `prompts/NOTES-decisions-and-compliance.md` §C) and logged the choice here with the prefix
   `OVERNIGHT-DEFAULT — CONFIRM:` so the owner can grep and confirm each one.

Client-only facts that the agent could not know (CIF/NIF, legal name, premises addresses, real
opening hours, real limits) were stubbed with obvious placeholders (e.g. `TBD-CIF-NIF`) and logged
with the prefix `OVERNIGHT-PLACEHOLDER — CONFIRM:` here and in `BUILD-LOG.md`.

The single condition that would halt the whole run early: `composer check` failing after genuine
fix attempts (a `STATUS.md` would be written at the repo root if so).

## Architecture decisions (from CLAUDE.md — the initial working agreement)

- **Profile: Full app** (real transactional domain: memberships, wallet ledger, dispensations,
  till/cash, reports). Full architecture: Actions + ViewModels + fat models + thin controllers.
- **No repository pattern; no service layer by reflex.** Business logic in fat models or
  single-purpose `App\Actions`. Page/dashboard assembly in `App\ViewModels`. Helpers in `App\Support`.
- **No payment provider (no Stripe).** Money is cash + a member wallet ledger, integer **cents**.
  A payment layer can sit on top of the ledger later without touching it. The kit's Stripe/Cashier
  install and webhook scaffolding are omitted.
- **No public / marketing site.** Legal constraint (Spanish CSCs may not advertise), not a
  preference: no landing page, no public menu, no SEO surface. `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` globally +
  `robots.txt` disallow-all. Filament panel mounted at `/`. The kit's public-site + SEO scaffolding
  is omitted.
- **Money = integer cents (EUR); weight = integer centigrams (0.01 g).** Euros/grams only at the
  input/display edge via casts (`App\Casts\MoneyCast`, `App\Casts\WeightCast`). One shared
  `round_half_up` helper. A float in either is a bug.
- **ULID primary keys on every user-addressable model.** No sequential integers in any route, API
  response, filename or QR payload — a hard security requirement (a competitor leaked ~1M records
  via sequential-id IDOR; see NOTES §B). ULID over UUID: time-ordered, index-friendly.
- **Scope = organisation_id + active location.** Custom location switcher + global scope, NOT
  Filament's built-in tenancy (owner rollup and org-wide member search must cross locations). One
  seeded org now; schema is org-keyed for future multi-org SaaS.
- **Multilingual: Spanish default, English second.** `APP_LOCALE=es`, `APP_FALLBACK_LOCALE=es`.
  All UI strings via `__()` from day one.
- **Compliance blocks, it does not just document.** Gram/age/carencia/membership checks enforced in
  the same DB transaction as the stock movement. Overrides are permissioned (manager+), reasoned,
  logged.
- **Never cache transactional data** (takings, stock, balances, occupancy, limits — always live).
- **Every threshold is a Setting**, never a constant.
- **Test DB:** SQLite in-memory locally (fast); a MySQL profile (`phpunit.mysql.xml`) for CI because
  production is MySQL and SQLite-only testing hides driver-difference bugs.

## Bootstrap library choices (rationale — the brief left several open with "e.g.")

The build machine has **PHP 8.5, gd (with WebP/PNG/FreeType), no imagick, Redis running, MySQL
running (root, passwordless), Chrome.app present but no CLI chromium/puppeteer**. Libraries were
chosen for robustness in an *unattended* run (no binary that could silently be missing):

- **PDF → `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` (dompdf), not spatie/laravel-pdf + Browsershot.** dompdf is
  pure-PHP with no external binary; Browsershot needs a headless Chromium that could be missing/
  broken mid-run (the brief itself flags this as the day-one risk). The legal documents (libro de
  socios, actas, Z-reports, entry–exit sheets) are tabular/text — well within dompdf's CSS 2.1
  support. If pixel-perfect HTML/CSS fidelity is later required, Browsershot can be swapped behind
  the same document Actions.
- **QR → `chillerlan/php-qrcode`, not simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode.** simple-qrcode's PNG output
  needs the **imagick** extension, which is not installed; chillerlan renders PNG via **gd**
  (`QRGdImage`), which is present. Pure-PHP otherwise.
- **Spreadsheet → `openspout/openspout`.** Low-dependency, memory-efficient streaming reader/writer
  for XLSX + CSV — good for large report exports and the member CSV import. A thin
  `App\Support\Spreadsheet` wrapper gives an ergonomic API.
- **Image → `intervention/image` v3 (+ `intervention/image-laravel`) on the gd driver.** Handles
  crop-at-upload, WebP encode, and metadata stripping (re-encode drops EXIF) with gd; no imagick or
  media-library table imposed (ID docs/photos are custom models on a private encrypted disk).
- **Web Push → `laravel-notification-channels/webpush` ^11.** Required a `-W` install so composer
  could downgrade `brick/math` 0.18 → 0.17.2 (the webpush → minishlink/web-push →
  web-token/jwt-library chain caps brick/math at ≤0.17; laravel/framework and ramsey/uuid both allow
  0.17, so this is safe).
- **Redis client → `predis/predis` (pure-PHP), `REDIS_CLIENT=predis`.** The **phpredis** C
  extension is not installed; predis needs no extension. Horizon works on predis.
- **Error monitoring → `sentry/sentry-laravel`.**
- **Static analysis → `larastan/larastan` at level 6** (raise later), `--memory-limit=2G` in the
  check script so it won't OOM as Filament resources accumulate.
- **Tests: PHPUnit** (the skeleton ships PHPUnit, not Pest).
